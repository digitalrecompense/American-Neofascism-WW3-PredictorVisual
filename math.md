# Components

### A. Domestic Authoritarian Escalation (DAE)

Metric	Evidence / Indicator	Weight	Current Score (0-1)

Pretext Expansion	DOJ/White House memos expanding domestic counterterrorism authority	0.15	0.9

ICE & Detention Capacity	Alligator Alcatraz operational, ~100k bed target	0.20	0.85

Military Deployments	NG + Marines in LA, Portland	0.20	0.75

Political Actor Protection	Jan 6 pardons	0.10	0.95

FBI / DOJ Capture	Kash Patel, politicization	0.15	0.8

Legal / Political Pushback	State lawsuits, public opposition	-0.05	0.5

Missing Lethal Authorization	No EO / DOD order to use lethal force domestically	-0.10	0

DAE Weighted Sum:

DAE=0.15∗0.9+0.20∗0.85+0.20∗0.75+0.10∗0.95+0.15∗0.8−0.05∗0.5−0.10∗0=0.767

→ High domestic authoritarian potential (~77%). (initial)

### B. International Conflict / WW3 Risk (ICR)

Metric	Evidence / Indicator	Weight	Current Score (0-1)

Direct Threats to Allies	Greenland letters, aggressive rhetoric	0.25	0.95

Military Signaling	DOD posture, troop mobilization, nuclear readiness rhetoric	0.20	0.7

International Condemnation	EU, NATO, Russia/China opposition	0.10	0.85

Historical Escalation Behavior	Impulsivity, past criminal / norm-violating actions	0.20	0.9

Escalation Feedback Loops	Potential retaliation from other states	0.15	0.65

Diplomatic Restraint	Absence of formal declarations	-0.10	0.2

Nuclear / Strategic Weapons Use	Not yet observed	-0.10	0

ICR Weighted Sum:

ICR=0.25∗0.95+0.20∗0.7+0.10∗0.85+0.20∗0.9+0.15∗0.65−0.10∗0.2−0.10∗0=0.758

### C. Coupled Risk Adjustment

We introduce a Domestic Escalation Multiplier (DEM) to reflect how domestic authoritarian consolidation amplifies international risk:

ICRadj=ICR+(DAE∗0.15)=0.758+(0.767∗0.15)=0.872

→ Current estimated risk of U.S.-triggered WW3 ≈ 87%, based purely on documented actions, deployments, and Trump’s historical behavioral patterns. (ADJUSTED)

### D. Visualization (Conceptual)

Axes:

X-axis: Domestic Authoritarian Escalation (0-1)

Y-axis: International Conflict / WW3 Risk (0-1)

Overlay:

Heat zones:

Green: Safe / Low risk

Yellow: Watch / Medium risk

Red: High risk (DAE > 0.6 & ICR_adj > 0.7)

Current Position:

DAE = 0.767

ICR_adj = 0.872

Falls in Red: Extreme Alert Zone

Event-Driven Updates:

Event Type	Score Modifier	Effect

New EO authorizing domestic lethal force	+0.15 DAE, +0.05 ICR	Pushes DAE → 0.92, ICR_adj → 0.95

Confirmed nuclear alert	+0.10 ICR	ICR_adj → 0.95

New ICE political-target detainee report	+0.05 DAE	DAE → 0.82

Major international retaliation (e.g., NATO mobilization)	+0.10 ICR	ICR_adj → 0.88

### E. Observations / Critical Notes

The trajectory is accelerating due to aggressive foreign threats, domestic pretext expansion, and partial institutional capture.

All major friction points (courts, international pressure) still provide some constraints. The “missing barrier” — explicit lethal domestic authorization — is the primary gating factor.

Criminality / norm-violation behavior (pardons for political actors, obstruction patterns, impulsive threats) is now factored in explicitly and materially boosts risk in both domestic and international axes.

Real-time update protocol: Any new EO, DOD memo, ICE operational targeting, or nuclear alert immediately triggers recalculation.
