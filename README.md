# American-Neofascism-WW3-Dashboard


I’ve created a timeline-based risk visualization for Linux using Matplotlib.

X-axis: Time (Jan 2025 → Jan 2026)

Y-axis: Risk score (0–1)

Red line / markers: Domestic Authoritarian Escalation (DAE)

Blue dashed line / markers: International Conflict / WW3 Risk (ICR_adj)

Event annotations: Key events like pardons, EOs, military deployments, and Alligator Alcatraz

Black dotted line: Critical WW3 tipping point at 0.9

You can run this script in any standard Python terminal environment on Linux. It will show how domestic and international risks have evolved and highlight events that push toward the tipping point.
