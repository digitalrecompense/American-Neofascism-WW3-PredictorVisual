# American Neofascism WW3-Predictor Plot


###### I’ve created using Grok an updated visualizer prgoram that can be used in realtime for multiple purposes.


##### * Robust News Analyzer & Risk Visualizer (no scikit-learn)
##### * Works in Colab, local Jupyter, even restricted browser environments
## Run in Google Colab: 
## paste → run cells → enter topic when prompted


example:

### NOTE: You may have to install some dependencies so that Google Collab runs the code correctly without crashing.

### If you run into issues try using this as the very first cell, run it to install the dependencies required:

# !pip install feedparser requests beautifulsoup4 nltk scikit-learn matplotlib pandas
